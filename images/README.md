# Local images for POD PDFs

Put your image files here. They are loaded once and embedded in the PDF (no network wait).

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| `watermark.png` | Watermark on each POD page |
| `logo-shadowfax.png` | Courier logo when courier name contains "shadowfax" |
| `logo-dtdc.png` | Courier logo for DTDC |
| `logo-xpressbees.png` | Courier logo for Xpressbees |
| `logo-ekart.png` | Courier logo for Ekart |
| `logo-delhivery.png` | Courier logo for Delhivery |

- Use **PNG or JPG**. Same filenames, any of these extensions work.
- If a file is missing, the app falls back to the remote URL (or no image for logos).
